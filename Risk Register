### 2.3 Risk Assessment

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category      | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Impact (H/M/L) | Priority  |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| R1      | Delays in implementing secure authentication systems, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. | Technical | Medium | High | High |
| R2      | Miscommunication between team members due to remote collaboration. | Communication | High | Medium | High |
| R3      | Scope creep from stakeholders requesting additional features. | Scope | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| R4      | Security vulnerabilities in financial data storage that could lead to data breaches. | Security | High | High | Critical |
| R5      | Low user adoption due to complex UI/UX. | Usability | Medium | High | High |
| R6      | Data loss due to server crashes or cyber-attacks. | Technical | Low | High | Medium |
| R7      | Integration failures with third-party services such as investment data providers. | Integration | Medium | High | High |
| R8      | Performance issues affecting system responsiveness under high user load. | Performance | Medium | High | High |

### 2.4 Risk Mitigation Plan

| Risk ID | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| R1      | Implement OAuth-based authentication early, conduct penetration testing, and follow security best practices. |
| R2      | Schedule daily stand-up meetings, use project management tools like Jira, and maintain clear documentation. |
| R3      | Define project scope in the project charter, implement a strict change request process. |
| R4      | Use AES-256 encryption, conduct periodic security audits, and apply access control policies. |
| R5      | Conduct usability testing, collect user feedback, and refine UI/UX iteratively. |
| R6      | Implement automated backups and failover mechanisms, conduct regular recovery drills. |
| R7      | Conduct integration testing, create contingency plans for third-party failures. |
| R8      | Optimize database queries, implement caching strategies, and conduct performance stress testing. |
